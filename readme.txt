*** Description ***

The program in Python folder takes the input file generated by the pre-processing algorithm delivered in C++ folder, runs it through a DQN and returns an assigned cluster and server. This covers the first and second layer in the H2O Cloud task scheduling framework. 


*** Running time ***

It takes some time to get all the data processed. According to our measurements, the running time is around 90 minutes (depending on the computing power).


*** Library requirements ***

You will need the following libraries installed in your computer for the code to run:
	+ tensorflow
	+ numpy

If any library is missing, you can install it through:
	- pip3 install name_of_the_library	


*** Files ***

In order to run the program, you need to download all the files and folders on the same directory:
	+ wrapper.py
	+ C++ folder
	+ Python folder



*** Running the program ***

Once all the files are already in place, please run the program by executing:
	- python3 wrapper.py

1 The command will automatically compile the C++ code using Makefile and run the C++ code to preprocess data:
  Generating "tasks-1.txt" "tasks-6.txt" "tasks-9.txt" 

2 Then command will run python code to schedule the clusters/servers for tasks from the txt file
  Generating "clusters.txt" "servers.txt"



*** Potential version issues ***

The code needs the user to have specific versions to work appropriately. To check the version that you currently have:

 - python3 --version # Should be 3.x.x
 - pip3 list | grep tensorflow # Should be 2.1.0 or greater
 
In case tensorflow is not the correct version, to upload type:

	- pip3 install --user --upgrade tensorflow

After upgrading, restart your computer.
